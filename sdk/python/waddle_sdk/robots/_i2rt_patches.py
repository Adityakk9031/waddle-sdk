"""Narrow compatibility patches for the pinned I2RT YAM transport.

The pinned I2RT receive loop polls SocketCAN in one-millisecond slices against
one wall-clock deadline.  If the Python thread is descheduled across that
deadline, it returns without checking the socket once more.  A healthy reply
then remains queued, is consumed by the next motor transaction, and starts a
cascade of false per-motor timeouts.

The transaction also discards its recovery receive even when that frame is the
expected reply. Match replies throughout its existing 10 ms initial and 9 ms
recovery budgets, skipping unrelated frames without restarting either deadline.

This module keeps the workaround inside the vendor adapter.  It patches only
the exact verified method signature, preserves I2RT's public behavior, and
fails closed when the installed vendor package has drifted.  Custom robot
drivers and the generic SDK contracts are unaffected.

The pinned ``MotorChainRobot.command_joint_state`` also replaces its shared
command object with an all-zero object *before* taking the command lock.  The
server thread can therefore publish one gravity-only tick between ordinary
position/velocity commands.  The atomic replacement below builds the complete
command off to the side and swaps it under the vendor's own lock.
